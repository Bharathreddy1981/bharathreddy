WHAT IA ANSIBLE ?

It is one of the Configuration Management Tool.

There are some other Configuration Management Tool other than ansible like chef,puppet,etc..



WHY ANSIBLE ?

The same task must be repeated multiple times.Moreover, humans are prone to make errors. 
now these is where ansible ansible comes to rescue. and helps you become efficent operations team.

with ansible, a code is written once for the installation and deploy multiple times.
so can work on  more productive tasks rather than the repetitive ones.



Because it is one of the powerful Configuration Management Tool.

like --60 to 70%
chef -- 30 to 40%

It is easy to understand and easy to write the script.

Ansible is a push based tool.
Ansible it is a Agent less

THERE ARE BOTH WAYS WE CAN DO.
1)FIRSTLY THE CONNECTION OF SSH & INSTALLATION OF ANSIBLE IN MASTER SERVER.

2)AFTER INSTALLING THE ANSIBLE IN MASTER SERVER AND CONNECTING USING SSH.

so basically we have to  create some user .  (as ansible/bharath)

The same thing in worker node also.

->We have to give root permission to user that we have created in master and node server .

After then using ssh-keygen.

It will generate the hidden directory of .ssh.

In .ssh there we can see the bothe the publice and private keys i.e id_rsa ,  id_rsa.pub .

Using ssh-copy-id USER@IPADDRESS.

we can transfer the publice key to node server.

before we can do the copy command, We have to make the both the Master and Node servers PasswordAuthentication as YES.
and also ChallengeResponseAuthentication NO.


Q)why we have do.

Where we can do these is in /etc/ssh/sshd_config  file  we have to make these changes.

and later need to do systemctl restart sshd.

Now we can do the copy command.
